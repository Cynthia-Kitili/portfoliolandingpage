          <P>I am  Cynthia Kitili, currently pursuing a course in <strong>Electrical and Electronics Engineering.</strong>I am a pro in c and c++ programming language which are very interesting languages. My passion for electronics and codingthe has led me to the field of <span class="reason">Software development</span> through programming. I love the fact that technology is dynamic and everyday poses new inventions thus new learning and job opportunities. I believe that anyone can be anything especially if they have determination, self-control and passion because I am living proof that hardwork pays. I love giving out to the community; a reason that led me to start a group that unites people and together give back to the society.Check out the deatails on our facebook page<a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/category/Public-Figure/Lalania-YNA-103967277738542/"> Lalania Yna</a></P>

       <p class="rp">Reason For Joining a class on Programming Course</p>
       <p class="column">I developed an interest in <em>programming </em>right after I studied c++ and c programming in <a href="http://www.jkuat.ac.ke/">Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology </a>and I wanted to find out more about other programming languages. This burning desire led me to <a href="https://moringaschool.com/courses/software-development-course?gclid=Cj0KCQjwzbv7BRDIARIsAM-A6-3g9lfwAM5h5tUJ8xkdUVbEXK-r8M5l6tVHgysp6cn4IQZhUw92zO0aApbuEALw_wcB&utm_campaign=august_class&utm_medium=cpc&utm_source=google&utm_term=brand_campaigns">Moringa School </a>which is a very interesting school that teaches students how to learn and solve problems on their own,through pair programming and groups. I love how through programming a lot of things can be done especially in the field of Robotics, Website Development and Android Development just to mention a few. The school teaches<span class="reason">HTML, CSS, Java Script,Python, django and bootstrap</span> among others. The field of technology is very dynamic and most of the activities we do in our day to day life all lead back to programming. Machines that we use, our mobile phones and our laptops. I want to know more about how an application is created so that it can be accessed through the Graphical User Interface and how a website is created and so much more. My reason for choosing programming is so that I can know what is beyond the GUI. </p>
