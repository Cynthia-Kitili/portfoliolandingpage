          <P>I am  Cynthia Kitili, currently pursuing a course in <strong>Electrical and Electronics Engineering.</strong>  I have a passion for electronics and coding which has led me to the field of <span class="reason">Software development</span> through programming. I love the fact that technology is dynamic and everyday poses new inventions thus new learning and job opportunities. I believe that anyone can be anything especially if they have determination, self-control and passion because I am living proof that hardwork pays. I love giving out to the community; a reason that led me to start a group that unites people and together give back to the society.Check out the deatails on our facebook page<a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/category/Public-Figure/Lalania-YNA-103967277738542/"> Lalania Yna</a></P>
